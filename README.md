A chess game.

_Work in progress_

## Motivation

Growing up, I used to play a lot of chess with my dad. Since graduating from
college however, it's been difficult to find the time to sit down and play.
I intend for this app to allow us to connect and play games at our leisure
via email, sharing the current list of moves for the other to load up and
respond to. The app will likely remain completely serverless.

Also on the side, I want to play around with [Choo](https://choo.io/) ;-).

## How to run

Clone this repo, install dependencies, and start the local development server:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

## Running tests

    $ npm test
